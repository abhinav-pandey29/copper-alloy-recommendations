# Copper Alloy Recommendations

Welcome to the **Copper Alloy Recommendations** project, an ML-powered Streamlit app for recommending copper alloy compositions based on thermal conductivity. The app includes existing alloys from [Copper.org](https://alloys.copper.org/) and generates novel compositions using an inverse modeling approach from my thesis at the Australian National University in 2020. The full project report is available [here](docs/Project%20Report.pdf).


## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/copper-alloy-recommendations.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd copper-alloy-recommendations
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the app.

3. Enter the desired thermal conductivity value and click "Get Recommendations" to see the suggested copper alloy compositions.
